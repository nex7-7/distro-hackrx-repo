"""Riddle Solver Module

Implements special branching logic:
1. Fetch favourite city from the HackRx endpoint.
2. Map the returned city to a landmark using the supplied (intentionally shuffled) tables.
3. Based on the landmark, call one of five flight number endpoints.
4. Return a humanâ€‘readable string containing the flight number.

Design notes:
- Duplicate city entries across the two tables are resolved by keeping the first
  encountered landmark for a city (order preserves given listing). This is
  sufficient because flight resolution depends only on four landmark names.
- All network operations use an injected httpx.AsyncClient to reuse connections
  managed by the caller (FastAPI endpoint).
